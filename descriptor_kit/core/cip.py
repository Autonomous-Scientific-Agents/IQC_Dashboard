"""Alkyne carbon CIP labeling (C1/C2) — pure CIP, no overrides.

Spec §5.1.  Convention is INVERTED: c1 = carbon bearing the LOWER-priority
substituent, c2 = carbon bearing the HIGHER-priority substituent.

This kit uses PLAIN CIP only.  A symmetric alkyne, whose two substituents are
CIP-indistinguishable, cannot be ordered by CIP; the tie is broken by input atom
number (C1 = the alkyne carbon with the smaller geometry index, source
"symmetric_atom_order").

The alkyne organic fragment ({cA,cB} + both substituents, Ni stripped) is rebuilt
as a metal-free RDKit molecule on *our* distance-based connectivity, bond orders
are perceived with rdDetermineBonds.DetermineBondOrders(charge=0) (neutral,
closed-shell), then the two substituents are ranked by CIP.

    no further substituents (children = empty).
